CURRENT WORK:
- Color champion borders green/red/mixed based on the team they belong to 
THEN:

IDEAS:
- Keyboard shortcuts

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Revamp team icons

BUGS:

- Picks have a transition period when picking a champion, you can see the scale on the default pick icon, it's ugly

- Search bar doesnt remove the last space
