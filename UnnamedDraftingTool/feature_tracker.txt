CURRENT WORK:

- An indicator for selected champions

- An indicator for selected roles

- An indicator for selected teams

THEN:


IDEAS:

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Keyboard shortcuts

- Revamp team icons

- When dragging from pick to a pick, the champions should be swapped

- Comfort level indicator for champions (border coloring repurposed?)

- Give feedback on correct/incorrect data (background color in the input element?)

- A manual is needed on the front page, could be a shorter version of the docs

- When dragging set the image to a champion file

- Select a slot if no champ is selected, then the next champion goes into that slot

- When a team is omitted in the json input, pull it from the default config

- Make an options menu

- Make "everything" customizable with a config file

- Testing
