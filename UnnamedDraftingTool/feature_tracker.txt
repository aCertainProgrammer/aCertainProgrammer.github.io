CURRENT WORK:

- A manual is needed on the front page, could be a shorter version of the docs

THEN:

IDEAS:

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Revamp team icons

- Comfort level indicator for champions (border coloring repurposed?)

- Give feedback on correct/incorrect data (background color in the input element?)

- When dragging set the image to a champion file

- Select a slot if no champ is selected, then the next champion goes into that slot

- Testing

BUGS:
